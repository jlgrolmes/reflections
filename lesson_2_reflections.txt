What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git creates a .git file to keep track of the metadata associated with file versions in my repository.  The initialization process begins the version control tracking of my repository in git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows you to pick and choose an appropriate selection of files from your working directory in preparation for a commit.  This allows you to create commits that are associated with logical changes in the project.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can use the staging area to only add the files that were changed for a logical change to the corresponding commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches can help by allowing multiple code developers to "divide and conquer".  Each developer can work on a specific branch for a specific task and then when ready merge their work into the master branch.
